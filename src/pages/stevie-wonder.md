<p>When Little Stevie Wonder (as he was billed) was 13 years old he scored his first US Number One Single, "Fingertips". He remains the youngest solo artist to top The Billboard Chart.

As well as performing as a Motown act, Stevie also worked penning songs, he wrote "Tears Of A Clown" for Smokey Robinson & The Miracles.

In September 1976 the double album 'Songs in the Key of Life' became the first by an American artist to debut straight at No. 1 in the Billboard charts, a position it for 14 weeks.

Wonder was the first Motown artist to win an Academy Award for Best Original Song, which he won for his 1984 hit single "I Just Called to Say I Love You" which featured in the movie 'The Woman in Red'.

Stevie Wonder has achieved ten US number-one hits on the pop charts and has sold over 100 million records. He is one of the top 60 best-selling music artists with combined sales of singles and albums.

No solo artist can match Wonder for success at The Grammys. He won the best album award in successive years for Innervisions (1975) and 'Fulfillingness' First Finale' (1976) and has 25 awards in all. At the 2015 Grammys he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2005, Kanye West paid Stevie Wonder the highest compliment. He said of his own work, "I'm not trying to compete with what's out there now. I'm really trying to compete with Innervisions and Songs in the Key of Life. It sounds musically blasphemous to say something like that, but why not set that as your bar?"

Stevie Wonder sang at the Michael Jackson memorial service in 2009, at Etta James' funeral, in 2012, and a month later at Whitney Houston's memorial service. He has also performed at happier high-profile events including The 2005 Live 8 concert in Philadelphia, the Super Bowl in 2006, the Obama Inaugural Celebration in 2009, the the 1996 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.

Wonder is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday a holiday in the United States. HIs 1980 single "Happy Birthday" was written and released for the campaign.
